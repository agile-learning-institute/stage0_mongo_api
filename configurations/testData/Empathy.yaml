  discussion_prompt: 
    - Who is this person, ask for name, role, age and hobbies, and place this information on stickies in the center circle.
    - Alliteration's for name and role are good at this stage such as Chris the Customer. 
    - We ask about age and hobbies to make the audience think about who this person really is.
    - Point out that what they do and say should be easy, what have you heard say or seen them do. 
    - What they think or feel requires a bit more consideration, it helps to think of a specific person in this role.
  example: "TODO: Come up with good does, says, thinks, feels example"
